Some information about me and this blog

### WhoAmI

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano.
From an academic point of view my main interests are related to AI and robotics,
from a broader point of view I like a pretty big amount of things, ranging from music and books/comics to whatever catches my attention for more than a consecutive week.

### Why this blog

The reason for this blog is preety straightforward, I always liked the idea of a blog but I never had the time to try and learn HTML, CSS and so on, and I didn't really like the narrow range of customization of classic blog providers in their free version.
Then I learned about GitHub Pages and it had all I wanted: 
* it was free
* it had unlimited and geeky customization capabilities with Jekyll
* it was almost as easy to get started as Blogger or WordPress

### What's this blog about

This blog is not about me in a strict sense, it will be about stuff that catches my eye, wether it is from a Computer Scientist point of view or not.
Maybe there will be also something about stuff I'm doing or stuff that happens to me.
